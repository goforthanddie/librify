    <h1>Welcome to librify. A shelter for the audiophile at heart.</h1>
    <p>Having always used a distinct structure for my music library, I slowly figured that the way Spotify is presenting music to me has changed my listening behaviour. It changed from a very self-determined genre- and album-centric way to catching myself listening to either radios based on a recently played song or the same albums that I have been playing for the last days over and over again. I was missing my tree-like structure badly and figured that what Spotify is offering just did not suit me. So I ended up developing this tool to help me keep better track of my library and being able to quickly and comprehensively browse through the library.</p>
